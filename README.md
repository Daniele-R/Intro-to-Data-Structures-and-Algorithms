# ECE 3310 - Data Structures and Algorithms
For this course we learned the basics of Data Structures and Algorithsm. The main topics were memory allocation, pointers, linked lists, binary trees, and the different sorting algorithms.

For this repo, I just have some fun code that helped me understand the material better. Nothing too crazy nor worth to mention. Simply here for future reference if I need to go back to the basics.
